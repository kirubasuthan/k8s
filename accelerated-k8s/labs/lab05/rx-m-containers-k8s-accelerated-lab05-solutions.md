## Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Downward API Challenge Solutions

Try the following exercises on your own, using the class slides and the knowledge from this lab to guide you.

First, recreate the `special-config` ConfigMap if you deleted it:

```
~/dapi$ cd ~/appconfig

~/appconfig$ kubectl delete configmap special-config

~/appconfig$ kubectl create configmap special-config \
--from-literal=special.type=charm --from-literal=special.how=very

configmap/special-config created

~/appconfig$
```


### CHALLENGE 1

Mount the values of the `special-config` configmap as environment variables `SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY` and `SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY`,
and modify the `challenge-pod` to output the value of those variables to stdout

  - Configure the pod with the command `/bin/sh -c "echo $SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY $SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY"`

Using our existing ConfigMap called `special-config`.

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl get configmaps

NAME               DATA   AGE
kube-root-ca.crt   1      2d12h
special-config     2      50s

~/appconfig$
```

We are now going to use our ConfigMap as part of the container command.
The first imperative command creates the base manifest file:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl run challenge-pod --dry-run=client -o yaml  \
--image busybox --restart Never \
--env SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY=changeMe --env SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY=changeMe \
--command /bin/sh -- -c "echo \$SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY \$SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY" > cli-pod.yaml

~/appconfig$
```

Make the necessary edits to the environment variables to use the ConfigMap as environment variables as follows.

```
~/appconfig$ nano cli-pod.yaml && cat cli-pod.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: challenge-pod
  name: challenge-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - echo $SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY $SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY
    env:
    - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
      valueFrom:                # Change this
        configMapKeyRef:        # Add this
          name: special-config  # Add this
          key: special.how      # Add this
    - name: SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY
      valueFrom:                # Change this
        configMapKeyRef:        # Add this
          name: special-config  # Add this
          key: special.type     # Add this
    image: busybox
    name: challenge-pod
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Never
status: {}
```
```
~/appconfig$
```

Like the challenge-pod from the previous step, the container will pull the values of SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY and
SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY from the configmap. This time, however, it will use the container's shell to dump the values of those
environment variables.

Create the cli-pod:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl apply -f cli-pod.yaml

pod/challenge-pod created

~/appconfig$
```

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl get pods

NAME            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
challenge-pod   0/1     Completed   0          3s

~/appconfig$
```

With the pod created (and completed), check its log to see if the cli command was run and that the environment variables
were dumped to its STDOUT:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl logs challenge-pod

very charm

~/appconfig$
```

Once configMap values are declared as variables, you will be able to consume them as you would any other environment
variable inside any pod's container(s).

Remove the challenge-pod again:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl delete pod challenge-pod

pod "challenge-pod" deleted

~/appconfig$
```


### CHALLENGE 2

Modify the challenge-pod manifest to mount the `special-config` configmap as a volume

  - Configure the pod with the command `/bin/sh -c "cat /etc/config/special.how"`
  - You should be able to use `kubectl logs challenge-pod` to verify that the contents of special.how are printed

The following imperative command creates the base manifest file in yaml:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl run --dry-run=client -o yaml challenge-pod \
--image busybox --restart Never \
--command /bin/sh -- -c "cat /etc/config/special.how" > vol-cm.yaml

~/appconfig$
```

To declare ConfigMaps as volumes, make sure you use the `.spec.volumes.name` and `.spec.containers.volumeMounts.name`
keys to refer to the `special-config` ConfigMap. Edit the manifest to add the `volume` and `volumeMounts` configurations
to mount the configMap to the container:

```
~/appconfig$ nano vol-cm.yaml && cat vol-cm.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: challenge-pod
  name: challenge-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - cat /etc/config/special.how
    image: busybox
    name: challenge-pod
    resources: {}
    volumeMounts:                # Add this
    - name: config-volume        # Add this
      mountPath: /etc/config     # Add this
  volumes:                       # Add this
  - name: config-volume          # Add this
    configMap:                   # Add this
      name: special-config       # Add this
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Never
status: {}
```
```
~/appconfig$
```

In this spec, the special-config ConfigMap is mounted as a volume on the pod. The volume is then mounted in the pod's
container at /etc/config. The container's shell will then read the file special.how that should be mounted there:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl apply -f vol-cm.yaml

pod/challenge-pod created

~/appconfig$ kubectl get pods

NAME            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
challenge-pod   0/1     Completed   0          4s

~/appconfig$
```

Check the logs to see if the command succeeded:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl logs challenge-pod

very

~/appconfig$
```

That worked! When a ConfigMap is mounted in a volume, each key in the volume is treated as a new file that can be found
where the ConfigMap was mounted in the pod's container filesystems.

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl delete pod challenge-pod

pod "challenge-pod" deleted

~/appconfig$ kubectl delete cm special-config

configmap "special-config" deleted

~/appconfig$
```


### CHALLENGE 3

Deploy a pod running the `httpd:2.4` image that uses the following `index.html` document:

```
~/appconfig$ nano index.html && cat $_
```
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
	<p>The page has loaded successfully!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
```
~/appconfig$
```

- The index.html should be stored in the API and supplied to the pod's container when the pod is created.

Create the ConfigMap for `index.html`:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl create configmap my-webpage --from-file index.html

configmap/my-webpage created

~/appconfig$
```

- Webpages for Apache are placed in the `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` directory

Prepare the pod spec that mounts the configMap at the specified directory:

```
~/appconfig$ nano my-websvr.yaml && cat $_
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: my-websvr
  name: my-websvr
spec:
  containers:
  - image: httpd:2.4
    name: my-websvr
    volumeMounts:
    - name: webpage
      mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
  volumes:
  - name: webpage
    configMap:
      name: my-webpage
```
```
~/appconfig$
```

Apply and test the page:

```
~/appconfig$ kubectl apply -f my-websvr.yaml

pod/my-websvr created

~/appconfig$ kubectl get pods my-websvr -o wide

NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE              NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
my-websvr   1/1     Running   0          4s    10.32.0.4   ip-172-31-6-204   <none>           <none>

~/appconfig$ curl 10.32.0.4

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
	<p>The page has loaded successfully!</p>
    </body>
</html>

~/appconfig$
```
